# LaPyX

LaPyX is a Python library which acts as a preprocessor for LaTeX. It allows for embedding Python code inside LaTeX documents, rendering the output as though it were part of the host document.

**Note that LaPyX runs unsanitised Python code on your computer!** Treat any LaPyX file as though you were running Python; if you didn't write it, read it carefully before compiling.
